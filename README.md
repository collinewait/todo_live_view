# TodoLiveView

A simple todo list application that demonstrates the power and simplicity of Phoenix LiveView. I used it in [this blog post](https://medium.com/@collinewait17/how-to-build-a-phoenix-liveview-todo-list-app-with-testing-db0140c0e20b).

This app allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks in real-time. It has filters that display all, completed, and active tasks as shown in the gif below.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
